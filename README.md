### _Overview_

-   Add and view resources related to your school work
-   Organize your courses assginments however you want, and synch everything with your calendar
-   Get google assisstant to keep you up to date with you homework and zoom sessions
-   _Dream goals: smart scheduling with AI_   

### _Classes_
Classes are a bundle that groups everything you get in a class. For each of the following you'll have a deadline to process the time, and status check your progress. 

Material, and deadlines can imported from various sources, and uses basic image to text machine learning ready-to-go models: this is the most unique feature of our platform and hence we prioritize it after the doing the MVP app. It is not specified in an exact way, we will most likely reduce the scope as we start developing and pondering on the work needed to complete it.

-   **Chapters:**
    -   Material(Videos, files)
    -   Notes(Includes a very simple editor, to save links to useful resources and personal notes)
-   **Quizzes:**
    -   In-app(very simple or wouldn't be done if time is tight)
    -   Links
-   **Assignments:**
    -   Instructions(Videos, files)
    -   Notes
-   **Exams:**
    -   Resources(video, files)
    -   Notes

### _Schedule_
We won't be building a schedule from scratch, since there is a plethora of sufficiently good planner apps out there. Our task is the gather the deadlines reagarding all the elements in our Classes and export them to Google Calendar.

### _Reports_

Students get exhausted looking at screens all day. We want Google assisstant to help you remember all the important dates, get the schedule for tomorrow or review that you did for the day.

## _Resouces_

We want to facilitate resource gathering for students. Our intial brainstorming is the following(keep in mind this is a complicated issue that a lot of apps suffer from):

-   **QR codes:** every modular element in our app is represented by a code and can be attached to any Class or subelement.
-   **Extension:** we will have a chrome extension to upload resources from PCs(file, or URL)
-   **In-built camera with OCR:** scan physical documents for deadlines, add text to your course material or add them them to your notes
